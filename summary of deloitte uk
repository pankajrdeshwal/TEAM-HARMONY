The document titled "Future of the UK Mobile and Wider Communications Value Chain" (February 2022) by Deloitte examines the UK mobile network's role in the digitalization of the economy and society. Below are the key points:

Executive Summary
The UK mobile networks are crucial for sustainable economic growth, improving quality of life, and creating a resilient society.
While 5G deployment has begun, significant further investment (over £20 billion) is required to roll out nationwide high-performance 5G connectivity.
The mobile value chain is expanding, with increasing diversity of participants, including global players like mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), content providers, and equipment vendors, reshaping the competitive dynamics.
Investment Challenges
UK MNOs (Mobile Network Operators) are facing challenges in generating returns from 5G investments, as declining average revenue per user (ARPU) and competition from other sectors (like OTT services) weaken the business case for large-scale investment.
Profitability in the UK is lower than in other European markets, and there’s a risk that low returns could lead to delays or reductions in capital expenditure, particularly in marginal investments (e.g., rural and indoor coverage).
Value Chain Evolution
Over the past decade, the mobile communications value chain has transformed due to innovations in smart devices, applications, and network sharing, leading to falling prices and intense competition.
New entrants such as OTT service providers and device manufacturers have disrupted traditional revenue streams, with MNOs finding it challenging to monetize data services.
Future Priorities and Trends
5G Network Expansion: Full-scale 5G requires substantial further investments in infrastructure, particularly for densification and spectrum deployment.
Private Networks: The rise of private 5G networks for enterprises could be an opportunity but may also lead to competition and "cherry-picking" of high-value clients by new players.
Cloud Integration: Large global tech companies (hyperscalers) will play a growing role across the value chain, with edge computing emerging as a key area for future growth.
Network Innovation: MNOs are exploring innovations like OpenRAN and network sharing to cut costs and expand capabilities.
Policy and Regulation: MNOs face regulatory constraints, such as net neutrality, which limit their commercial flexibility and ability to generate returns.
The report emphasizes the need for collaboration between policymakers, MNOs, and other stakeholders to ensure widespread 5G availability across the UK, particularly in under-served areas, to unlock the full economic and social potential of digitalization​(deloitte-uk-future-of-t…).
